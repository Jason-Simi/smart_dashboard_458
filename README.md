# COVID Death Total Map

## Introduction 
This project is COVID Mapping project that is meant to be an interactive map that visualizes the impacts of COVID-19 on the United States throughout 2020.
I chose this map as I believe that it is important to be able to interact with the maps we make as it allows us to get a deeper understanding of the message 
being portrayed. A proportional symbol map allows this to be done more effectively that a choloropleth as the sizing of the circles allows for an immediate understanding
of the significance of that point.
